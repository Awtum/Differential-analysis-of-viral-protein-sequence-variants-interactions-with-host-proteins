## The task at hand

We have started to develop a flexible analysis of molecular interfaces between 2 arbitrary sets of residues in a tertiary or quaternary structure involving protein, RNA, DNA, small molecules.  It is especially aimed at studying in detail molecular interactions at the atom or residue level.  We can already compare SARS-CoV-1/SARS-CoV-2 interaction networks with ACE2 interactively  for example, or with other beta coronaviruses variants, but we should aim at developing an automated differential binding analysis.   Any other case can be envisioned, yet an outcome of this hackathon project is to develop a general method and provide a useful analysis to the community studying SARS-CoV-2 at the root of the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Why this is an important task

The interaction surface between the viral RBD and the human ACE2 is an important aspect of SARS-CoV-2 pathology and biology. The binding interface of SARS-COV2 has different (and more) anticipated contacts with the ACE2 protein than is expected for SARS-COV-1. This is just one of endless examples in which differential interactions with a protein may be biologically important to the protein of interest. iCn3D already includes many tools to explore the interface between two proteins, and can be modified to allow comparison between the binding potentials of 2 proteins to a third protein. By automating comparison of binding networks in subject and reference sequences, we will enable researchers to quickly and effectively interact with the protein binding mechanism. 

## Our plan towards a solution

We have 4 main goals in order to establish an approachable differential analysis of protein interactions. 

| Aim  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Automated differential residue interaction network identification between 2 arbitrary sets of residues (1 level).   |
| 2  | Contact tracing -- secondary and tertiary interactions. Pathways between interactions.  |
| 3  | Visualization of differential and conserved subnetworks with available tables  |
| 4  | Integration of side-by-side visualizations for 2D networks |
